### Teaser Website

One of the first things we wanted to do was announce Tandem to the world. We also wanted to attract more people to the [Co-Founders](/) community - so we had more people that were engaged in helping us achieve our vision. We decided a brand teaser landing page would help achieve this.

All design, interaction and build of the website was carried out by myself and [Christoph Backoefer](http://backoefer.com).

Static page designs:

<div class="img revealBottom"><img src="../assets/img/tdm-teaser-website/tdm-teaser-desktop.jpg" alt=""></div>

We wanted the website to feel unlike anything you would expect from a bank. We felt motion and transitions could re-inforce the message we wanted to get across and demonstrate that we were a bit different to other Banking or FinTech brands.

The motion's main purpose here was to show a variety of people all with a shared belief in building a better bank - randomised 'shuffling' of people's portraits showed that it was about working together.

The website was later expanded with an about page and a blog being added and was in use for around 8 months, contributing to over 5,000 Co-Founders signing.

It also acted as a point of reference for the press or investors.
