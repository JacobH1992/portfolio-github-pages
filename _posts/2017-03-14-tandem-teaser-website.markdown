## Teaser Website

One of the first things we wanted to do was announce Tandem to the world and allowed us to attract new [Co-Founders](/) that were engaged in helping us achieve our vision. We decided a brand teaser landing page would help with this.

All design, interaction and build of the website was carried out by myself and [Christoph Backoefer](http://backoefer.com).
