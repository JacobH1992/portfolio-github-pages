### A new brand



As an one of the first employees of Tandem I was fortunate enough to be involved in helping define a new brand - the outcome was Tandem.

Tandem is defined by its Co-Founders. A community of ordinary, un-banky people who are helping shape and build the kind of bank that will really help them out.

> Co-Founders are the lifeblood of Tandem and will continue to help shape our customer offering as we head towards launch.

### Teaser Website

One of the first things we wanted to do was announce Tandem to the world. We also wanted to attract more people to participate in the Co-Founders community. We decided to design and build a Tandem teaser website to act as a destination for people who wanted to join the Co-Founder community.

All design, interaction and build of the website was carried out by myself and [Christoph Backoefer](http://backoefer.com) under the supervision of John Alderson, Tandem's design director at the time.

Co-creation is at the heart of Tandem's brand. Our ambition for the site was to celebrate people from all walks of life coming together to build something new, something better. All faces and names are from real co-founders.

As co-creation is a vital part of Tandem's brand we wanted the website to represent the diversity of

We wanted the website to feel unlike anything you would expect from a bank. We felt motion and transitions could re-inforce the message we wanted to get across and demonstrate that we were a bit different to other Banking or FinTech brands.

The motion's main purpose here was to show a variety of people all with a shared belief in building a better bank - randomised 'shuffling' of people's portraits showed that it was about working together.

The website was later expanded with an about page and a blog being added and was in use for around 8 months, contributing to over 5,000 Co-Founders signing.

It also acted as a point of reference for the press or investors.
